# 👋 Hi, I’m Udai!



I'm a current final student at Imperial College London, studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering.

I’m interested in working on software that falls in the intersection between cool and useful, and love to contribute to projects.

I love road bikes : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmuP8gsgWb8.
