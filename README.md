# 👋 Hi, I’m Udai!

I'm a current third-year student at Imperial College London, studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering.

I’m interested in working on software and electronics that fall in the intersection between cool and useful, and love to contribute to projects that (could) change the world.

I love road bikes, always superfluously tinkering with all the components on my bike and racing around Richmond Park.
